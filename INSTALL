This package depends on QooxView, AfriCompta and LibNet. There should be a directory holding all directories:

# ls
QooxView  Gestion  AfriCompta  LibNet


# Gestion/Gestion

This will try to download all missing packets (down to ruby).

Short, it will do about:

# sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems libreoffice pdftk psutils sqlite libsqlite3-dev \
# default-jdk gettext

And then it will compile sqlite3-support, so a gcc-compiler should be present. A standard Lubuntu-installation
or Debian-Squeezy installation seems to run it well.

Once it's running, you can point your browser to

http://localhost:3302

and log in using admin/super123
