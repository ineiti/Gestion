This package depends on QooxView, AfriCompta and LibNet. There should be a 
directory holding all directories:

# ls
QooxView  Gestion  AfriCompta  LibNet


# Gestion/Gestion

This will try to download all missing packets (down to ruby).

Short, it will do about:

# sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems libreoffice pdftk psutils sqlite \
# libsqlite3-dev default-jdk gettext

And then it will compile sqlite3-support, so a gcc-compiler should be present. 
A standard Lubuntu, LinuxMint or Debian-Squeezy installation seem to run 
it well.

Once it's running, you can point your browser to

http://localhost:3302

and log in using admin/super123

======== Further installation

If you want to use it more thoroughly, I propose you go into

LibNet/tools

and run ./install there. This will copy some links around the system.


======== Slowness on connection

if the system reacts very slowly whenever there is a connection, check that the
DNS-server doesn't send out private reverse-requests (--bogus-priv on dnsmasq) and
also some other requests (--filterwin2k on dnsmasq)
