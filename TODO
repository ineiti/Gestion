BUGS:
        - CourseDiploma: 
          - diplomaDir doesn't have default value
          - update automatically
          - do files in alphabetical order
          - make print work
	- B 110826: It's possible to click other tab while first starting up: re-activate the
	  correct tab when getting "update" or "show"
	- window that pops up on wrong password is not in front
	- Delete CourseModify::add_students and put courses to add in PersonModify
	- When a window is shown, hide the rest
	- Accelerate adding of students (is LogAction::add_only enough?)
	- 1000 crashes when not operating "properly"
	
Rare bugs:
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
	- CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)
	
UserFriendly:
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
		- Make also focus for windows
	- CourseGrade: 
		- when selecting a course, cursor goes to "mean"
		- when pressing "save", cursor goes to "mean"
		- Add a method "focus" to Frontend
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
	- Make 2-dimensional field with "Course, Person, Cash, ..." on top and rest on left

FEATURES:
	- Printing attestations
		- exporting and importing grades
	- Person*: Search pops up windows
	- use language file to replace name of the fields
	
Programming:
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Adding or changing names of persons is not reflected in list_drop (see TaskList)
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	
DOMINIQUE:
	- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
	
NELBE:
	- Voir qui a payé combien pour l'internet - ici ou AfriCompta?

	  			is saved :( - delete list of things we don't want
