BUGS:
	- Change lots of ids and stuff to value_entity
	- Installation
		- SQLite crashes when database is not here yet
		- When using data from solar on local account, fails
	- 1000 crashes when not operating "properly"
	
Security:
	- PersonModify - only allow to change password from persons which have equal or
	  lower rights - use an own tab which is not active for non-allowed users

UserFriendly:
	- Widen "students"-field so that all text fits in CourseGrade
	- Delete CourseModify::add_students and put courses to add in PersonModify
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
	- Accelerate adding of students (is LogAction::add_only enough?)
	
UI:
	- Windows don't get hidden when working (CourseModify::bulkAdd)

FEATURES:
	- Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	- Make internet.wifi with Self::Internet only, and a link which allows
	  to do the infamous internet.wifi/?pass=&user=
	- Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	- CourseHistory
	- AfriCompta-support:
		- Gestion acts like a server, and clients can merge with it
		- Add Account and Movement
		- Synchronize with AfriCompta
		- Define reports
	- NELBE:
		- Voir qui a payÃ© combien pour l'internet - ici ou AfriCompta?

Programming:
	- kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm nut sure the latter really works...)
	- rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	
Programming > 1.0:
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities
	- DOMINIQUE:
		- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
		- Bibliotheque

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- B 110826: It's possible to click other tab while first starting up: re-activate the
	  correct tab when getting "update" or "show"
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
	- CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)

** FIXED **:
	- B 120602 - Addcredit doesn't work anymore
			   - add test for LogActions
			   - add password-changes to logactions
			   - Add logging to all Person-changes
			   - Lots of changes in Person and Entity::set_data* - have to check
	- P 120602 - change Entity::(data_set|set_data|set_entry) to a more meaningful set
				 - took data_set, data_set_hash and data_set_log
	- B 120530 - QooxDoo-error when viewing Admin-tabs (fade on not yet visible elements)
			   - Command-line options different for tests and real
			   - QooxDoo-error when no elements in parent-tab
			   - Add a method "focus" to Frontend - doesn't work in PersonTabs
			   - some operations are very slow
			     - CashAdd takes time to fill up the whole log - is not standard anymore
			   - When adding a person twice to a course, he appears twice in the course
	- B 120528 - VTListPane: when adding new elements, "null" appears
			   - value_entity: is not saved
	  P 120528 - value_entity: - also do show_entity
	- B 120526 - Adding PersonAdmin::account_due doesn't allow user to use AfriCompta
	  			 directly
	- B 120524 - PersonModify - Everything is gone when the password is changed
			   - PersonAdmin - InternetNone keeps values when switching user...
			   - When adding cash in PersonModify, it doesn't show in the user
	- B 120523 - CourseModify - editStudent doesn't work
				- parents( switch_tab, update ) doesn't work as supposed, as the
		  		  rpc_calls from "switch_tab" get done after "update". Add a local
		  		  variable to each parent-tab which holds eventual values to be over-
		  		  written to the available values
			   - PersonAdd - should directly open in PersonTabs
			   - When switching from/to CourseTabs, course is not highlighted anymore
	- B 120522 - CoursTabs - add should be in its own tab, delete protected
	- B 120522 - Permissions are mangled with tabs...
	- UI120517 - Resizing is nicer for login-screen again
	- B 120516 - add translation for tab-names
	- B 120516 - CourseTabs - new_course doesn't work
	- B 120515 - CourseModify waits for all students to populate

		and forth to it

	- B 120509 - *Tabs: when changing sub-tabs, the field-elements of the *Tab should be sent over,
		especially in Course*
	- UI120504 - Make 2-dimensional field with "Course, Person, Cash, ..." on left and rest inside from top
	- F 120503 - use language file to replace name of the fields
	- B 120331 - Wrong order in View::rpc_update_view
	- B 120328 - cash doesn't show up in CashAdd - oups, error in LogActions!
	- P 120327 - change value_entity_Persons to value_entity_person
	- P 120326 - Make value_entity a reality!
		120323 - added first code.
		120324 - do code in Value.to_a for entity
		120324 - push entity with "id:name" in Value.to_a
		120326 - View.rpc_parse_reply searches for entities and converts them back
	- P 120323: Further automize: Take first part of View-class as the standard entity,
		only if the specific entity exists
	- T 120323: All test cases work

	- AC120127: Start with SQLite-StorageType
	- EB120107: @data_class has to be kept for general use and not for classes that
		know their Entity
			- get_entity is used for Person-class only anyway, so let's drop it
			- Session gets new instance variable "owner" instead of Person
	- EB120102: "sid" is replaced with "session", and has members that allow to
	    access already chosen entities
	    - Add class Session
	    - move session-ids from "Permission" to here
	- B 120102: Are all necessary views shown? - yes

		- when selecting a course, cursor goes to "mean"
		- when pressing "save", cursor goes to "mean"

	  			is saved :( - delete list of things we don't want
	- B 110630: internet_none disappears when saved from PersonModify, as the Frontend only sends
	  			back an empty array (because nothing is chosen)
