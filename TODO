/* -*- shiftwidth: 4; softtabstop: 4 -*- */

BUGS:
        - Doesn'r work anymore with empty data/-directory
        - When only main-tabs, they are always faded - not reproducible
         on local version
	- AfriCompta::check doesn't work anymore
	- 1000 crashes when not operating "properly"
	
[5', 15', 30', 1h, 4h]
Security:
	-3 PersonModify - only allow to change password from persons which have equal or
	  lower rights - use an own tab which is not active for non-allowed users

UI:
	-2 Print - Adjust text for PDF and Print

FEATURES:
        -2 Use Entities in Course::Modify
        -2 Renommer cours
        -3 Print student-cards the Markas-way with the idea of Josue and Viviane
        -2 Transfer money from one account to another directly in the interface
	-2 Make internet.wifi with Self::Internet only, and a link which allows
	  to do the infamous internet.wifi/?pass=&user=
        -2 keep session-ids over restarts
        -3 take Admin::ControlAccess from Rooms-definition
        -3 Add a status-bar on bottom for progresses and information like:
           printing, progress, messages, connect/disconnect, ...
	-3 Admin::Restore - show progress
	-3 Tigo - auto-reconnect on error
	-3 check diploma-templates
	-3 Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	-3 Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	-4 make an asynchronous printing-module
	-4 Courses::Days - add other days to the list
	-4 Double-users: merge them and avoid them in the first place
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
	- AfriCompta-support:
		-4 Don't show archived and deleted accounts, but do stats on them
		-3 Delete accounts
		-4 Define reports
	- CourseHistory - what should go in there?

Programming:
	-2 Allow subdirectories in Entities-directory
	-3 Remove QooxView/Storages/AfriCompta.rb and adjust
	 Gestion/Entities/Person.rb
	-3 add a print-dialog with window and buttons
	-3 Change Frontend::Views::LTab::dispatch to handle one request at a
	  time and to allow new requests to be inserted before handling other
	  requests -> doing a reply( parent->switch_tab ) + reply( switch_tab )
	  should switch the tab in the NEW parent-tab!
	-3 Installation
		- SQLite crashes when database is not here yet
		- When using data from solar on local account, fails
	-3 kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm nut sure the latter really works...)
	-3 when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	-3 Add real type-checking between value_* and Storages
	-4 rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	
Programming > 1.0:
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities
	- DOMINIQUE:
		- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
		- Bibliotheque

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- Better check of LDAP-dependency: if /etc/*/ldapscripts.conf is here,
	  use that one. Don't rely on Gestion/ldap.secret!
	- adding an already existing user crashes if he has been added outside
	  of Gestion: CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes 
          (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)
	- check why ruby-gettext from debian/squeeze messes things up

Unconfirmed bugs:
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything


** FIXED **:
        - F 121210: Use Inventory::Rooms in Cours::Modify
        - F 121210: Delete courses
	- F 121206: Migration of new data-types: have defaults and offer
         migration-support when changing values
	- UI121206: Cours::Noter should have a bigger and longer student-list
        - F 121206:  Add a working "version" to the welcome-screen, including
          main, sub and local versions (0.9.1-altatawwur)
        - B 121206: When showing Self::Cash, some entries may be shown double or
          triple, leading to an error "no multi selections in single mode"
          -> add an option to "show_txt" to not select upon double-lines
          (which was a stupid hack in the first time anyway)
        - F 121130: Use accounts in Self::Cash instead of LogActions
	- B 121130: Mon Compte - Dépenses is not updated, because it relies on LogAction
        - F 121129: Import old credits -> Admin::Credit
        - B 121129: Adding credit to a person who has nothing results in
          0 credit -> insert .to_i
        - B 121129: when only sub-tabs are visible (like "student"), it doesn't get unfaded
        - B 121129: why are all accounts checked for AfriCompta when autosaving?
          -> because of Internet::check_services
        - B 121129: connection::permanent and can_connect, show correct status
          in Self::Internet
        - F 121127: Automatically taking into account no-promotion settings
	- F 121127: When no promotion left, show only "disconnect"-button
	- B 121126: When sending something from "Frontend", stop the timer, then
	 restart it when the answer arrives
        - B 121126: Person::Tabs gets enabled before it gets unfaded
        - B 121122: First tabs shouldn't be clickable (while waiting to be positioned
         as should)
	- B 121122: Retirer le droit de noter a Secretaire

          any tab, the parent is ds
	- B 121122: if teacher has permission AdminAccess and AdminAccess.visible=false, it fails
        - F 121116: AfriCompta-support:
