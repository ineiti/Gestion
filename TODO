/* -*- shiftwidth: 4; softtabstop: 4 -*- */

WORKING:
        - reverse update( :empty, :empty_only ) to update( :empty_all, :empty )
        - Activities
            - Library: Adjust for MaN-cards
            - move Activities to "Entrées"
            - add librarian with rights to add address for library-users
            - allow multiple-print in "Entrées::Activities"
        - PersonTab::add - should offer more direct input fields
        - Adding ScheduleType to schools

BUGS:
        - Get QooxView/Test/qv_gettext to run
        - when migrating with old value-names, it gives an error - how to keep
          old names during migration?
        - QooxView-libs are not loaded before ruby-gems, e.g. librqrcode
        - When CourseAdd is first tab and course is added, LTab.js:174 can't
          find getActiveForm, as it is not drawn yet...
	- 10 crashes when not operating "properly"

[5', 15', 30', 1h, 4h]
Security:

UI:
        - if only Course-tabs are visible, the basic tab is not shown, so no
         tabs can be added

FEATURES:
        - reverse show_entity_lazy;show_entity to show_entity;show_entity_all
        - use list with entities also in reply( :update, :students => student )
        - allow for window-definitions outside of main gui_*
        - change View::CourseTab::persons for entity
            - change all other non-entity fields, too
        - Add Language-evaluations for MaN
        - Add value_bool to list
            - use for "lsusb" and "lpstat"
        - CSV-save
            - use directory for old files
            - link to newest file
        - LibNet:
          - Feature: rewrite in Ruby
          - Make LibNet working at least on ArchLinux
            - Network/Connections doesn't show variables
            - think about connections / Provider / Hardware / Others
              { PPP { Tigo, Airtel, Tawali } { E330, E303, Modem, ZTE },
                PPPoE { Prestabist } { eth[0-9] },
                Router { Simple, LibNet } { eth[0-9] } { address } }
        - "Files/"
            - easy editing
            - updating in both ways
        - Add date to Session, so old sessions can be deleted
        - Rethink CourseTypes:
          - versioning of coursetypes
          - CourseServer: changing of label/attestation by course_directors
          - CourseGrade - add comment to file-uploads, so people know what to
            upload
          - adding files to be print by teachers, like exams and others?
    	- Courses::Days - add other days to the list
        - CourseDiplomas: display random-id if available
          - only add center-ids when a course is "certified"
          - Admin:Backup - "send server", "fetch server", "download backup", "upload backup"
            - send-server: same as synchronize
            - fetch: to do, adding to courseTabs
            - download/upload backup: same as synchronize and fetch
            - import courses from server
        - Course::Grade - Syncing with server when course-type doesn't exist must
            return error -> only sync with CourseTypes fetched from server

        - Show what student payed all in CourseDiploma
        - /etc/gestion.conf - bash file for very basic configuration
          - BASE=/opt/profeda
          - LIBNET=$BASE/LibNet
          - VPN=profeda-man
          - search for all hard-coded paths and replace with /etc/gestion.conf
        - Have a simple interface that can act as a "monthly subscriber frontend"
          with MAC-identification
        - Add 'usage meter' for internet: current_usage * 100 / fastest_possible
          where current_usage and fastest_possible are measured every 5 minutes if
          people are online, else every hour
        - Entities::Person.account_service should be replaced by
          ConfigBase.account_service

        - Put adding of students and printing as background-tasks

        - Progression-meter for Report::Executive
        - clean up the interface, mostly the tabs and sub-tabs
        - write a good documentation...
        - AC: correctly show differing accounts in "check"

        - add init-script for Gestion to "service gestion restart"

        - configure better print, libnet, uploadwidget, so that it get's correctly
          addressed with a configuration
        - when a student logins remotely to a course_sever, don't allow to change
          his name, only address, phone-#, password and e-mail
        - adding a course:
          - add m/f recognition to change wording
          - Implement better handling of course-days
        - label. : show a form if no student found
        - progression-bar in Administration::Backup::restore
	-3 check diploma-templates

Programming:
        - Move Gestion::Reports to AfriCompta
        - CourseStats: when adding a course, account_entries is not updated
          -> should probably do a "watch account-changes and update if changed"
            thingie
        - LibNet has concurrency-troubles - use "flock" to mend it:
          ( flock -e 200; locked commands ) 200>/tmp/blah.lockfile
        - why is Entity::get_value always called three times?
        - replace all 'undefined' variables with class-variables
        - Change ConfigBase functions_base: all functions are evaluated with
          base_dependencies, like network, network_share and network_internet,
          so that network_internet and network_share depend on network
        - Why is a value_list-definition in Entities not able to give a default-
          value for the list? -> it is, but only if it is taken as a show_block
          in a View, test whether show_field works, too
        - merge two ways of free surfing: group::freesurf and
          permissions::FreeInternet
        - Lots of stuff in View/* should go into Entities/*
        - configure also LibNet through Gestion
          - 130400 can set cost_* now
          - 130400 also change permanent or 
        - replace gsm-ussd with something Debian
        -2 verify if Person::data_set and Person::data_set_log are really
          necessary
        -3 change Course::make_pdfs to OpenPrint

Documentation:

> 2.0
Features:
        - Add a cookie to log in automatically
        -2 Rename course
        -3 Add a status-bar on bottom for progresses and information like:
           printing, progress, messages, connect/disconnect, ...
	-3 Admin::Restore - show progress
	-3 Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	-4 make an asynchronous printing-module
	- Using data from solar on local account without failing
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	-2 Make internet.wifi with Self::Internet only, and a link which allows
	  to do the infamous internet.wifi/?pass=&user=
        -3 take Admin::ControlAccess from Rooms-definition
	-Tigo
          - 3 auto-reconnect on error
          - vérifier si la sim est expirée
          - Montrer le log des derniers communications avec le Modem
	-3 Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	- CourseHistory - what should go in there?

Programming:
        - Calling rpc_calls
          - Convert all "args" to_sym!
          - take out last [0]-arrays needed in args
	-2 Allow subdirectories in Entities-directory
	-3 add a print-dialog with window and buttons
	-3 Change Frontend::Views::LTab::dispatch to handle one request at a
	  time and to allow new requests to be inserted before handling other
	  requests -> doing a reply( parent->switch_tab ) + reply( switch_tab )
	  should switch the tab in the NEW parent-tab!
	-3 kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm nut sure the latter really works...)
	-3 when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	-3 Add real type-checking between value_* and Storages
	-4 rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities
	- DOMINIQUE:
		- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
		- Bibliotheque

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- Better check of LDAP-dependency: if /etc/*/ldapscripts.conf is here,
	  use that one. Don't rely on Gestion/ldap.secret!
	- check why ruby-gettext from debian/squeeze messes things up
        - When copying compta.db over to standalone AfriCompta, then checking,
         some accounts are marked as "local only" - why? - because the "check"
         doesn't return ALL accounts, but only those attached to a top-level
         account - now, why are not all accounts attached, and what to do about
         them? - seems to be rests of Accounts::archive, but concrete
         circumstances are not known...
        - Restriction is not waterproof: some local sites don't get shown, like
          markas-al-nour.org which gets wrongly resolved by internal zentyal-boxes
          eventually also problems with local logins

Unconfirmed bugs:
        -V Sync-error on server if family-name is not given
        -? lpstat localhost:631 hangs if no cups is running - what system?
        - ??? Wrong printer-dialog in Cours/Attestations/Print
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
        - Course::Diploma - can't create for more than one course at the same time
          -> make a @thread for each course, or is it just ruby not really
          multi-threaded?
        - Test if Admin::Backup::restore resets passwords as it should in samba-module

UNCLEAR BUGS:
        - ne pas afficher dans label quand "pas passé" -> when creating?
        - missing fields won't work in Entity::to_hash( true ) ??

HEISENBUGS:
        - Course::Modify::add_course - GUI doesn't come up once added - only
          under certain circumstances
        - wrong-password-window can't get clicked away -> not reproducible on 1.3.0-rc1
        - can't set up cybermanager anymore - permissions vanish !? - or was it
          unclear setup of get_config::Accounting?
        - Confirmed: NetworkPermissions: sometimes when saving, the chosen entry shows up
          as a number in the list. Seems to be somewhere in the Javascript where
          things don't get updated in the correct way. Not reproducible in a
          reliable manner. Perhaps linked with more than one field as array like
          130625?
        - Confirmed: PersonAdmin sometimes doesn't show permissions and groups when
          added new stuff -> also array-problem of 130625?

To check:
        - printing of student-card with accent in name fails (probably due to
          accent in filename - sanitize using "accents_replace")
        - Fresh install with Course::add_missing doesn't work because of missing
          file in CourseType
        - creation of diplomas breaks if argument "-p" is given


** FIXED **:
        - B 141010: transfer-errors are not caught correctly
        - B 141010: Entities with id=0 should not exist and return nil
        - F 140929: client/server:
          - get course-types from server
            - fetch course-description from server
            - Move Course::sync to ICC
                - "Transferring exam" doesn't show "%" anymore
                - move ICC to QooxView
            - when error in thread, UI should be informed
        - B 140929: Data corruption when turning off while saving
            - don't load 0-byte files
            - how to save:
                - rename all .tmp-files to normal files
                - write .tmp-files
                -> this would let a margin of 1 minute to get everything out on
                  the disks
        - B 140918: Assistants don't show up in course::modify::assistant
        - B 140918: secretary can't print exam-files
        - B 140915: AfriCompta doesn't pass most tests!
        - UI140915: make Views::Reports::Usage faster by not re-calculating everything when
            changing dates and duration
        - UI140915: Slowness in UI
          - 140509: misuse of search_all is logged now
          - 140509: most very slow occurrences (Persons.search_all) are removed
          - check Log.search_all occurrences
          - CourseTabs still very slow for startup
          - Slowness in CourseGrade when saving students
            - don't "update" uidnumber, sn and givenname if not needed
        - B 140915: Internet: bizarre "kicked ... because of inactivity"
        - B 140915: UsageStat
            - add handling of .gz-files
            - doesn't work with Files from buzz
        - B 140915: Synching to server drops files! - some packets are missing?
            - transfer one user at the time
            - show transferred/total on server-end
        - B 140913: usagestats are always shown - wrong header
        - B 140913: error in test using zip_read - wrong adding of course-directory
        - F 140909: Reporting on file downloads
        - F 140909: Add "upto"-field for transfer
        - P 140904: Storage/CSV
            - adding flag "changed" to entries and class
                - test "add_only" - should be OK (tm)
            - Add flag to CSV-storage so that a new element doesn't involve writing
             down of all elements -> only with "add_only"-flag
            - Add a number of 'backup'-files with ending .0, .1, ..., then saving
             one after the other. Add a timestamp at the beginning of the file,
             then start with the youngest.
                - If the loading fails, try the older file
                - add a YYYYmmddHHMMSS-tag and delete those older than n minutes
            - When saving CSV, save in "*.sav", then sync, then rename and sync again
             mostly with regard to SD-cards that have troubles when writing the CSVs
             -> this is WAY TO SLOW to do things!!
        - F 140830: client/server
          - first get a hash of everything stored on the server with its md5-sum,
            then compare what needs to be copied over
        - B 140828: Entity.method_missing is not really adding methods!
        - B 140828: Sometimes data is not saved!
        - B 140828: Checking why sometimes data is not saved
            - a problem is in "QooxView:Storages:CSV" save and create methods,
            which can step on each others toes
        - Fetchmail
            - B 140624: When no email at all, fetchmailrc is not rewritten
            - F 140624: fetchmail should fetch things in small portions
            - F 140624: add "limit" and friends to fetchmail
        - F 140620: Change course-type and name
        - B 140620: Views/Course/Print - still problem with pdf/printer/pdf/printer/...

        - F 140620: Add SMS-control panel
        - F 140611: SMScontrol gets going
        - client/server:
          - B 131113: server: when getting new course, ignore "room", check
            for center-id
          - B 140605: CourseGrade::sync - catch timeouts on requests and ECONNRESET

        - B 140513: catch uncomplete value_entity-definitions
        - B 140512: with new search_all, passwords of persons get overriden with new

          to Self-tab
          - Verify correct disabling of tabs when waiting for answer

            "CourseServer", the "label"/center/random doesn't work and says
            "no such id" - after restart it works...
          - F 140502: has also to be able to change the "attestation_function"
            of a teacher or responsible

          -> because of non-auto-callback in lists? Then switch it on per default
           and add non-auto-callback-list instead of auto-callback
           -> reply( :update, ... ) updates with callback
           -> reply( :update_silent, ... ) updates w/o callback
        - F 140416: CourseModify: transfer student while keeping accounts updated

          Windows computers anyway
        - B 130219: Why does it sometimes redirect to stuff like http://admin:3302/?afdj ??
          -> send proper files and do some regex-magic in Frontend/Lib/RPC.js

        - F 130201: 2/5 Transfer money from one account to another directly in the interface
        - B 130201: creation of accounts is not reliable. Probably fields of

          triple, leading to an error "no multi selections in single mode"
          -> add an option to "show_txt" to not select upon double-lines
