BUGS:

        - CourseDiplomas: very slow when enqueuing files - qrcode?
        - when migrating with old value-names, it gives an error - how to keep
          old names during migration?
        - Fresh install with Course::add_missing doesn't work because of missing
          file in CourseType
        - QooxView-libs are not loaded before ruby-gems, e.g. librqrcode
        - creation of diplomas breaks if argument "-p" is given
        - why is Entity::get_value always called three times?
        - When CourseAdd is first tab and course is added, LTab.js:174 can't
          find getActiveForm, as it is not drawn yet...
	- 10 crashes when not operating "properly"

[5', 15', 30', 1h, 4h]
Security:

UI:
        - CourseGrade::sync - catch timeouts on requests
        - CourseGrade - add comment to file-uploads, so people know what to
          upload
	- CourseDiplomas: take away "print to PDF" and insert direct links 
          in the table -> take care about security-risk if only adding a
          simple manager for diplomas
        - CourseTabs still very slow for startup
        - SelfChat: if on multilogin, propose a "name"-field

        - CourseDiplomas: display random-id if available
        - Courses::center needs work:
          - it isn't shown in CourseModify, even with center_server
          - it is by default to responsible (at least installation from 130613)
        - auto_update from a window enables also the background (CourseGrade::sync)
        - if only Course-tabs are visible, the basic tab is not shown, so no
         tabs can be added
        - clean up the interface, mostly the tabs and sub-tabs
        - write a good documentation...

FEATURES:
        - make an accounting-module

        - use multilogin as flag for users
        - configure better print, libnet, uploadwidget, so that it get's correctly
          addressed with a configuration
	- import courses from server
        - logrotate gestion.log, and send daily error-reports to info@profeda.org
        - when a student logins remotely to a course_sever, don't allow to change
          his name, only address, phone-#, password and e-mail
        - adding a course:
          - add m/f recognition to change wording
          - Implement better handling of course-days
        - label. : show a form if no student found
        - receive SMS through LibNet and do actions
          - make connection
          - return stats
        - progression-bar in Administration::Backup::restore
	-4 Courses::Days - add other days to the list
	-3 check diploma-templates

Programming:
        - Change ConfigBase functions_base: all functions are evaluated with
          base_dependencies, like network, network_share and network_internet,
          so that network_internet and network_share depend on network
        - Why is a value_list-definition in Entities not able to give a default-
          value for the list? -> it is, but only if it is taken as a show_block
          in a View, test whether show_field works, too
        - merge two ways of free surfing: group::freesurf and
          permissions::FreeInternet
        - Lots of stuff in View/* should go into Entities/*
        - configure also LibNet through Gestion
          - 130400 can set cost_* now
          - 130400 also change permanent or 
        - replace gsm-ussd with something Debian
        -2 verify if Person::data_set and Person::data_set_log are really
          necessary
        -3 change Course::make_pdfs to OpenPrint

Documentation:

> 1.0
Features:
        - Add accounting for students-money and service-money
        - Add a cookie to log in automatically
        -3 Print student-cards the Markas-way with the idea of Josue and Viviane
        -2 Rename course
        -3 Add a status-bar on bottom for progresses and information like:
           printing, progress, messages, connect/disconnect, ...
	-3 Admin::Restore - show progress
	-3 Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	-4 make an asynchronous printing-module
	- Using data from solar on local account without failing
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
        - AfriCompta-support:
		-4 Define reports
	-2 Make internet.wifi with Self::Internet only, and a link which allows
	  to do the infamous internet.wifi/?pass=&user=
        -3 take Admin::ControlAccess from Rooms-definition
	-Tigo
          - 3 auto-reconnect on error

	-3 Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	-4 Double-users: merge them and avoid them in the first place
	- CourseHistory - what should go in there?

Programming:
        - Calling rpc_calls
          - Convert all "args" to_sym!
          - take out last [0]-arrays needed in args
	-2 Allow subdirectories in Entities-directory
	-3 Remove QooxView/Storages/AfriCompta.rb and adjust
	 Gestion/Entities/Person.rb
	-3 add a print-dialog with window and buttons
	-3 Change Frontend::Views::LTab::dispatch to handle one request at a
	  time and to allow new requests to be inserted before handling other
	  requests -> doing a reply( parent->switch_tab ) + reply( switch_tab )
	  should switch the tab in the NEW parent-tab!
	-3 kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm nut sure the latter really works...)
	-3 when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	-3 Add real type-checking between value_* and Storages
	-4 rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities
	- DOMINIQUE:
		- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
		- Bibliotheque

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- Better check of LDAP-dependency: if /etc/*/ldapscripts.conf is here,
	  use that one. Don't rely on Gestion/ldap.secret!
	- adding an already existing user crashes if he has been added outside
	  of Gestion: CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes 
          (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)
	- check why ruby-gettext from debian/squeeze messes things up
        - When copying compta.db over to standalone AfriCompta, then checking,
         some accounts are marked as "local only" - why? - because the "check"
         doesn't return ALL accounts, but only those attached to a top-level
         account - now, why are not all accounts attached, and what to do about
         them? - seems to be rests of Accounts::archive, but concrete
         circumstances are not known...
        - Restriction is not waterproof: some local sites don't get shown, like
          markas-al-nour.org which gets wrongly resolved by internal zentyal-boxes
          eventually also problems with local logins

Unconfirmed bugs:
        - ??? Wrong printer-dialog in Cours/Attestations/Print
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
        - Course::Diploma - can't create for more than one course at the same time
          -> make a @thread for each course, or is it just ruby not really
          multi-threaded?
        - Test if Admin::Backup::restore resets passwords as it should in samba-module

UNCLEAR BUGS:
        - ne pas afficher dans label quand "pas passé" -> when creating?
        - missing fields won't work in Entity::to_hash( true ) ??

HEISENBUGS:
        - can't set up cybermanager anymore - permissions vanish !? - or was it
          unclear setup of get_config::Accounting?
        - Confirmed: NetworkPermissions: sometimes when saving, the chosen entry shows up
          as a number in the list. Seems to be somewhere in the Javascript where
          things don't get updated in the correct way. Not reproducible in a
          reliable manner. Perhaps linked with more than one field as array like
          130625?
        - Confirmed: PersonAdmin sometimes doesn't show permissions and groups when
          added new stuff -> also array-problem of 130625?

To check:
        - printing of student-card with accent in name fails (probably due to
          accent in filename - sanitize using "accents_replace")


** FIXED **:
        - B 130919: PersonAdmin: when deleting person that is shown, there is an error,
          in fact, it is only in the case when a course has a wrong attribute...

          doesn't get transferred
        - UI130917: extend lists on all the height
        - P 130917: Do something with CSV that don't load - first store in .sav, then

          can't restart Gestion anymore with a new call to start_gestion
        - UI130909: PersonTabs - put search on top of results and stretch results all
          the way down - added a gui-option of "flexheight"
        - F 130822: Network::Share - add "force (user|group)" to smb.conf
        - UI130822: Delete selection of a table upon "empty"

        - B 130822: Form is still active, even if shaded out
        - UI130822: CourseGrade - list is sorted, but selected student is not on top
        - B 130822: Label: "Pas passé" is not "passé avec succès"
        - B 130822: CourseDiplomas: when nothing converted yet, it's like it's already
          done
        - B 130820: Config:LibNet:simul whether we do the forking or not
        - B 130820: LibNet:: readlines somewhere in env where file does just not exist..

          - put everything into a "real" table to select and do proper printing
          - show if file exists yet or not
        - F 130705: when adding a student to a course, check whether he already exists.
          for example: if same username exists, propose to take over the other
          name

        - B 130704: CourseGrade::sync_files should be shown also when no files needed
        - B 130704: Grades: re-writing means or remark resets "random", even when it was the
          same value
        - F 130704: Adding courses:
          - Possible conflict in random-numbers when created locally and uploading
            to server -> create random-numbers on server and copy to local, takes
            also care of being sure it's synched: as long as there is no random-number,
            don't allow to print diplomas. When changing Grades, delete random-number
          - If course_client, don't make PDF before synched to server
          - Once synched to server, don't allow for changes, or have a system that
            prevents abuses like changing the grade afterwards, but allowing to
            change in case of errors -> grade and remark changes need a new
            sync

        - B 130624: when uploading, a file get's created instead of a directory
        - P 130620: clean up config.yaml with uppercase, lowercase, also replaced
          most of the direct $config-uses with get_config
        - P 130620: added an Entities.needs for classes so that they can be
          made to rely on each other -> shudder for dependency-troubles
        - D 130620: make a nice config.yaml.default which contains all major configurations
        - F 130618: Cours::Grade - send files directly without sync
        - B 130618: empty installation: CourseModify complains about no CourseTypes, even
          when one was added -> problem in html-display -> pops up a

         permissions and groups, only address!
        - P 130604: Why is a false return-value in Entities::setup_data used for not
          auto-loading data? Change this to a @auto_load variable which is "true"
          by default... But first check who is really returning a false value anyway
        - F 130604: Have the possibility of storing course-data centrally
          - input multiple notes
          - store files for exams
          - send everything to profeda.org with the notes
          - 130528 for remote-only labels, add possibility for creating teachers
          - 130530 add the name and place of the center - center itself

        - B 130411: Person::Admin if adding "share", what to do with the password of the
         samba-user? Store it anyway in clear, then add it to samba? Stupid, INSECURE

          change the password
        - B 130315: When entering user-name only, a bug appears -> 
         probably LDAP-related... yes, confirmed. Now it asks for the password

          Windows computers anyway
        - B 130219: Why does it sometimes redirect to stuff like http://admin:3302/?afdj ??

        - F 130201: 2/5 Transfer money from one account to another directly in the interface
        - B 130201: creation of accounts is not reliable. Probably fields of

        - B 121206: When showing Self::Cash, some entries may be shown double or
          triple, leading to an error "no multi selections in single mode"
