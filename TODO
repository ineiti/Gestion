BUGS:
	- Make rounding in Account-total
	- Better check of LDAP-dependency: if /etc/*/ldapscripts.conf is here,
	  use that one. Don't rely on Gestion/ldap.secret!
	- Why is account.total not updated?
	- Migration of new data-types: have defaults
	- check diploma-templates
	- AfriCompta::check doesn't work anymore
	- check why ruby-gettext from debian/squeeze messes things up
	- Mon Compte - Dépenses is not updated, because it relies on LogAction
	- Personnes - Admin is not always updated
	- if teacher has permission AdminAccess and AdminAccess.visible=false, it fails
	- when clicking on tab while other tab is loading, it loops endlessly
	- when no student passes, it crashes
	- In Self::Cash, Self::Services don't show up
	- Diplomas/base_gestion.odt is missing in MaN-version 332:30802485413c
	- 1000 crashes when not operating "properly"
	
Security:
	- PersonModify - only allow to change password from persons which have equal or
	  lower rights - use an own tab which is not active for non-allowed users

UserFriendly:
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
	- Accelerate adding of students (is LogAction::add_only enough?)
	
UI:
	- Windows don't get hidden when working (CourseModify::bulkAdd)
	- Cours::Noter should have a bigger and longer student-list

FEATURES:
	- Add a "role"-field to user, that can be used in the Diplomas
	- Add "version"-field somewhere
	- AfriCompta-support:
		- 120724 - Add Account and Movement
		- 120912 - Gestion acts like a server, and clients can merge with it
		- 120924 - Synchronize with AfriCompta
		- 120925 - Update Person-class to use new AfriCompta
		- Use accounts for internet-cash
		- Archive old accounts
		- Delete accounts
		- Define reports
	- Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	- Make internet.wifi with Self::Internet only, and a link which allows
	  to do the infamous internet.wifi/?pass=&user=
	- Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	- CourseHistory
	- NELBE:
		- Voir qui a payé combien pour l'internet - ici ou AfriCompta?

Programming:
	- Remove QooxView/Storages/AfriCompta.rb and adjust
	 Gestion/Entities/Person.rb
	- Allow subdirectories in Entities-directory
	- add a print-dialog with window and buttons
	- Change Frontend::Views::Layout::dispatch to handle one request at a
	  time and to allow new requests to be inserted before handling other
	  requests -> doing a reply( parent->switch_tab ) + reply( switch_tab )
	  should switch the tab in the NEW parent-tab!
	- Installation
		- SQLite crashes when database is not here yet
		- When using data from solar on local account, fails
	- kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm nut sure the latter really works...)
	- rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	- Add real type-checking between value_* and Storages
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list
	
Programming > 1.0:
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities
	- DOMINIQUE:
		- Statistiques de "Cours::accounting"
		- Bibliotheque

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- B 110826: It's possible to click other tab while first starting up: re-activate the
	  correct tab when getting "update" or "show"
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
	- CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)

** FIXED **:
	- B 121024: Why is account.movements.each{|m| m.to_json} so slow? account.update_total?
	    - dputs is evaluated even for not-shown levels, fixed

	  AfriCompta.new and Persons.add_cash

	- B 120623 - Sometimes Diplomas/* gets deleted! BAD - Course.diploma_dir didn't get udpated
				- different small bugs in diploma-handling
	- F 120623 - Added blocking of computers (at least front-end, still need to do iptables)
	- P 120623 - Entity corresponding to Entities is created automatically - more concise, but
				bug-prone...
	- B 120619 - No PDF-export in Person::Modify::Print, Person::Add::Print
	- B 120614 - New installation under Lubuntu1204 should work
				- DropDown don't update on changes:
					- Inventory::Computers::rooms doesn't update on new rooms
					- Course::Modify::teachers don't update on new teachers
				- Self::Cash doesn't update
				- person is not displayed correctly:
					1. Person::search viviane
					2. AdminPerson

					5. Modify Student
					6. AdminPerson still shows viviane
					7. switching to ModifyPerson doesn't work
				- Add PDF-export if printer is empty
	- B 120605 - Change lots of ids and stuff to value_entity
				 - Tested adding CourseModify::another, but troubles of having the

			   - Lots of changes in Person and Entity::set_data* - have to check
	- P 120602 - change Entity::(data_set|set_data|set_entry) to a more meaningful set
				 - took data_set, data_set_hash and data_set_log
	- B 120530 - QooxDoo-error when viewing Admin-tabs (fade on not yet visible elements)
			   - Command-line options different for tests and real
			   - QooxDoo-error when no elements in parent-tab
			   - Add a method "focus" to Frontend - doesn't work in PersonTabs

			   - value_entity: is not saved
	  P 120528 - value_entity: - also do show_entity

			   - When adding cash in PersonModify, it doesn't show in the user
	- B 120523 - CourseModify - editStudent doesn't work
				- parents( switch_tab, update ) doesn't work as supposed, as the
		  		  rpc_calls from "switch_tab" get done after "update". Add a local
		  		  variable to each parent-tab which holds eventual values to be over-
		  		  written to the available values
			   - PersonAdd - should directly open in PersonTabs
			   - When switching from/to CourseTabs, course is not highlighted anymore

			- Session gets new instance variable "owner" instead of Person
	- EB120102: "sid" is replaced with "session", and has members that allow to
	    access already chosen entities
	    - Add class Session
	    - move session-ids from "Permission" to here
