/* -*- shiftwidth: 4; softtabstop: 4 -*- */

ENTITY_BASE:
	- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
	- Other tabs with actions on each entity
	- Recognize entities from View-name
		- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
		 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
	- cleanup:
		- arrays with strings coming from Frontend
		- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity

BUGS:
	- 1000 crashes when not operating "properly"
	
UserFriendly:
	- Replace text-field in info-boxes with HTML-field 
	- Widen "students"-field so that all text fits in CourseGrade
	- Delete CourseModify::add_students and put courses to add in PersonModify
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
	- Graying out fields not usable (PersonModify, CashAdd, ...)
	- Make 2-dimensional field with "Course, Person, Cash, ..." on top and rest on left
	- Accelerate adding of students (is LogAction::add_only enough?)

FEATURES:
	- CourseHistory
		- 
	- use language file to replace name of the fields
	- Person*: Search pops up windows

Programming:
	- Further automize: Take first part of View-class as the standard entity
	- Add a method "focus" to Frontend
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- having lists and dropbox with additional hidden "index" that is returned for chosen entries
		- Tasks reference a "person" which can change instead of a "person_id"
		- Can't change name of courses
		- Add a method "select" instead of sending a list-item twice
	- make class to easy allow for a "add/delete"-list

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- B 110826: It's possible to click other tab while first starting up: re-activate the
	  correct tab when getting "update" or "show"
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
	- CourseModify::add_students doesn't work sometimes (when there is a stale uid of a removed user)
	
** FIXED **:
	- EB120107: @data_class has to be kept for general use and not for classes that
		   know their Entity
			- get_entity is used for Person-class only anyway, so let's drop it
			- Session gets new instance variable "owner" instead of Person
	- EB120102: "sid" is replaced with "session", and has members that allow to
	    access already chosen entities
	    - Add class Session
	    - move session-ids from "Permission" to here
	- B 120102: Are all necessary views shown? - yes
	- B 120102: PersonShow doesn't work anymore - fixed
	- B 111216: CourseGrade: all teachers can grade all courses - only appropriate teachers should be able to grade

	- B 111215: CourseModify: "students" is not deleted when clicking tab
	- UF111215: CourseModify: Add a "Edit user"-button

	- B 111208: CourseModify::del_student - login-names pop up in "students"
	- B 111108: Windows:
		- Make also focus for windows
		- window that pops up on wrong password is not in front
		- When a window is shown, hide the rest
		- Use first_button from windows

		- diplomaDir doesn't have default value
		- do files in alphabetical order
	- B 111021: CourseDiploma:
