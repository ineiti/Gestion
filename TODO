:1:dputs`log_msg'xxxxxxxxxxxxx Info from SerialModem: Re-sending *128# for 3

        - SerialModem: accept all variations of "cmd:" "cmd :" "cmd: " "cmd : "
        - parseconfig-gem doesn't recognize comments - where did that version come from?
          - https://github.com/antw/iniparse
          - https://rubygems.org/gems/inifile
        - Shouldn't get printers for Windows

        - ConfigBase::send_config is called before migrate_*
        - Admin::Import::Courses - doesn't download grades and exams
        - Monitor::Traffic - all data is lost when RTC is wrong!
        - Check Report::executive
        - Documentation, documentation

        - Course::Diplomas - labels not right anymore when creating diplomas
            - probably only when multiple people create diplomas at the same time
        - when course_server and user is admin, add the following:
            - ask for center when creating course
                - only if there is more than one center
                - display is not correct
            - edit of center
            - add students with prefix of center, not of user
            - why is there a Course::center-method? This should come from Courses.setup_data!
        - profeda.org: can't edit student in course abc_PC-1_1500
        - captive-tables are not updated when configuration changes
        - after a couple of logins, View.rpc_list is 10x slower, but only on Cubox
            - seems like every hash-lookup is 10x slower - need to investigate
                further
    	- 10 crashes when not operating "properly"

Bugs to watch:
        - Error in ConfigBase which doesn't update correctly the accounts when starting
          without accounting

For 2.0:
        - Put data-directory elsewhere
        - Make a gem-compatible installation
        - Migrations:
            - all statics in views and entities
                - View::Network::Block

Security:

UI:
        - Cours::Grade::sync
            - should only go to 'OK' if files are transferred:
                - transfer exams before transferring grades
            - table: 'status'-column should show 'do_sync' instead of 'sync'
        - saving of admin::functions is very slow when having to update lots of
          users with their accounts...
        - Replace :empty_nonlists with :empty and :empty_update
        - Person::add should focus on name-field -> trouble in QooxView::Frontend
        - add-button in different views should always pop up a window with
          the information to add, never just an empty form
            -> delete fields when pressing 'new' and empty forms when switching tab
            - empty forms should be disabled (like Person::Modify), in
              TemplateCourse, NetworkShare, ...

FEATURES:
        - Add control-panel for distributed Cuboxes
        - Distributed Cuboxes search and execute automatically a command
        - send reports home
        - Monitor::Ping
            - the idea of logrotate is very clumsy. Store everything in a file in
                /var/log/monitor/ping_yymmdd.log and delete oldest files
        - update: search on profeda/github for latest version
        - captive_dev should depend on the actual device used
        - SerialModem: needs to be ported as a class
        - CourseType
            x added internet_free_* to configbase
            - add drop: "internet_always, internet_course, none"
            - add to course
        - remove accounting from admin-rights
        - Check auto-update of Antivirus and other stuff
        - import all data from a center
            - write tests
            - export all data to server
        - Get time and date from SMS
        - Add Cashbox::Other which covers all other Income-accounts
        - make simple printer-conf
        - CoursesTabs - Drop-down to select courses

        - Bibliotheque
        - Courses::Grades can have more than the necessary files ->
            - show downloadable list of files
        - limit speed upon reaching threshold
            - calculate threshold
        - add EditAccounts::move
        - Pruning out left-overs in LibNet -> Network transition
            - Entity and taking care of values (int, str, bool, array)
        - Adding ScheduleType to schools
        	- Courses::Days - add other days to the list
        - "Files/"
            - easy editing
            - updating in both ways
        - Rethink CourseTypes:
          - versioning of coursetypes
          - CourseServer: changing of label/attestation by course_directors
          - CourseGrade - add comment to file-uploads, so people know what to
            upload
          - adding files to be print by teachers, like exams and others?
        - CourseDiplomas: display random-id if available
          - only add center-ids when a course is "certified"
          - Admin:Backup - "send server", "fetch server", "download backup", "upload backup"
            - send-server: same as synchronize
            - fetch: to do, adding to courseTabs
            - download/upload backup: same as synchronize and fetch
            - import courses from server
        - Course::Grade - Syncing with server when course-type doesn't exist must
            return error -> only sync with CourseTypes fetched from server

        - Show what student payed all in CourseDiploma
        - /etc/gestion.conf - bash file for very basic configuration
          - BASE=/opt/profeda
          - LIBNET=$BASE/LibNet
          - VPN=profeda-man
          - search for all hard-coded paths and replace with /etc/gestion.conf
        - Have a simple interface that can act as a "monthly subscriber frontend"
          with MAC-identification
        - Add 'usage meter' for internet: current_usage * 100 / fastest_possible
          where current_usage and fastest_possible are measured every 5 minutes if
          people are online, else every hour

        - Put adding of students and printing as background-tasks

        - clean up the interface, mostly the tabs and sub-tabs
        - write a good documentation...

        - add init-script for Gestion to "service gestion restart"

        - when a student logins remotely to a course_sever, don't allow to change
          his name, only address, phone-#, password and e-mail
        - adding a course:
          - add m/f recognition to change wording
          - Implement better handling of course-days
        - label. : show a form if no student found
        - progression-bar in Administration::Backup::restore
	-3 check diploma-templates

Programming:
        - migration: don't migrate on new installation, but use something like
          'default_values'-method
        - ConfigBase: include default-values
        - icc-calls are not secured with username/password
            - use encoding json-library

        - change ConfigBase.send_config to rely on ConfigBase.update
        - Get QooxView/Test/qv_gettext to run
        - QooxView-libs are not loaded before ruby-gems, e.g. librqrcode
        - when migrating with old value-names, it gives an error - how to keep
          old names during migration?
            - there would have to be a storage of the old names, like the first line
             of the CVS or the data given by the sql-database
        - change gui_* :nogroup to gui_* only and add gui_* :group
        - use list with entities also in reply( :update, :students => student )
            - for the moment add .to_frontend:
                reply( :update, :students => student.to_frontend )
              this works for entities and arrays of entities. Shoule be generalized
        - allow for window-definitions outside of main gui_*
        - change View::CourseTab::persons for entity
            - change all other non-entity fields, too
        - Add value_bool to list
            - use for "lsusb" and "lpstat"
        - Move Gestion::Reports to AfriCompta
        - CourseStats: when adding a course, account_entries is not updated
          -> should probably do a "watch account-changes and update if changed"
            thingie
        - why is Entity::get_value always called three times?
        - replace all 'undefined' variables with class-variables
        - Change ConfigBase functions_base: all functions are evaluated with
          base_dependencies, like network, network_share and network_internet,
          so that network_internet and network_share depend on network
        - Why is a value_list-definition in Entities not able to give a default-
          value for the list? -> it is, but only if it is taken as a show_block
          in a View, test whether show_field works, too
        - merge two ways of free surfing: group::freesurf and
          permissions::FreeInternet
        - Lots of stuff in View/* should go into Entities/*
        -2 verify if Person::data_set and Person::data_set_log are really
          necessary
        -3 change Course::make_pdfs to OpenPrint

Documentation:

> 2.0
Features:
        - Add a cookie to log in automatically
        -3 Add a status-bar on bottom for progresses and information like:
           printing, progress, messages, connect/disconnect, ...
	-3 Admin::Restore - show progress
	-3 Import attestation.markas-al-nour.wifi
	-4 make an asynchronous printing-module
	- Using data from solar on local account without failing
	- Make a dropbox when using _find
        -3 take Admin::ControlAccess from Rooms-definition
	-3 Inventory of screens, mice, routers
	- CourseHistory - what should go in there?

Programming:
	-2 Allow subdirectories in Entities-directory
	-3 Change Frontend::Views::LTab::dispatch to handle one request at a
	  time and to allow new requests to be inserted before handling other
	  requests -> doing a reply( parent->switch_tab ) + reply( switch_tab )
	  should switch the tab in the NEW parent-tab!
	-3 kill Layout.js::dispatch::init_values, as it is not needed anymore with
	  the RPC-queue enabled (even though I'm not sure the latter really works...)
	-3 when empty configuration and LDAP is not here, fall back to CSV
	-3 Add real type-checking between value_* and Storages
	-4 rpc_parse_reply
		- take out arrays when only one reply anyway
	- Really slow search or something when starting up
		- also in CourseModify
	- ENTITY_BASE:
		- Have one tab with all Entities to chose from
		- Other tabs with actions on each entity
		- Recognize entities from View-name
			- PersonCourseModify has a person and a course entity chosen, available
			 through session.chosen.Person and session.chosen.Course
		- cleanup:
			- arrays with strings coming from Frontend ?!?
			- Cash* views have to be moved, as there is no "Cash"-Entity
		- convert views to value_entities

VERIFY:

Rare bugs:
	- Better check of LDAP-dependency: if /etc/*/ldapscripts.conf is here,
	  use that one. Don't rely on Gestion/ldap.secret!
	- check why ruby-gettext from debian/squeeze messes things up
        - When copying compta.db over to standalone AfriCompta, then checking,
         some accounts are marked as "local only" - why? - because the "check"
         doesn't return ALL accounts, but only those attached to a top-level
         account - now, why are not all accounts attached, and what to do about
         them? - seems to be rests of Accounts::archive, but concrete
         circumstances are not known...
        - Restriction is not waterproof: some local sites don't get shown, like
          markas-al-nour.org which gets wrongly resolved by internal zentyal-boxes
          eventually also problems with local logins

Unconfirmed bugs:
        -V Sync-error on server if family-name is not given
        -? lpstat localhost:631 hangs if no cups is running - what system?
	- PersonAdd - password is not stored - not repeatable
	- Default focus and button:
		- Frontend: when pressing a button, focus doesn't go back to the "std-focus"-element
			-> where is that a problem?
	- TaskList: sometimes when pressing "list", it takes twice to show everything
        - Course::Diploma - can't create for more than one course at the same time
          -> make a @thread for each course, or is it just ruby not really
          multi-threaded?
        - Test if Admin::Backup::restore resets passwords as it should in samba-module

UNCLEAR BUGS:
        - ne pas afficher dans label quand "pas passé" -> when creating?
        - missing fields won't work in Entity::to_hash( true ) ??

HEISENBUGS:
        - Course::Modify::add_course - GUI doesn't come up once added - only
          under certain circumstances
        - wrong-password-window can't get clicked away -> not reproducible on 1.3.0-rc1
        - can't set up cybermanager anymore - permissions vanish !? - or was it
          unclear setup of get_config::Accounting?
        - Confirmed: NetworkPermissions: sometimes when saving, the chosen entry shows up
          as a number in the list. Seems to be somewhere in the Javascript where
          things don't get updated in the correct way. Not reproducible in a
          reliable manner. Perhaps linked with more than one field as array like
          130625?
        - Confirmed: PersonAdmin sometimes doesn't show permissions and groups when
          added new stuff -> also array-problem of 130625?

To check:
        - printing of student-card with accent in name fails (probably due to
          accent in filename - sanitize using "accents_replace")

            - When saving CSV, save in "*.sav", then sync, then rename and sync again
             mostly with regard to SD-cards that have troubles when writing the CSVs

          - Possible conflict in random-numbers when created locally and uploading
            to server -> create random-numbers on server and copy to local, takes
            also care of being sure it's synched: as long as there is no random-number,

          - If course_client, don't make PDF before synched to server

        - P 130620: added an Entities.needs for classes so that they can be
          made to rely on each other -> shudder for dependency-troubles
        - D 130620: make a nice config.yaml.default which contains all major configurations
        - F 130618: Cours::Grade - send files directly without sync
        - B 130618: empty installation: CourseModify complains about no CourseTypes, even

          auto-loading data? Change this to a @auto_load variable which is "true"
          by default... But first check who is really returning a false value anyway
        - F 130604: Have the possibility of storing course-data centrally
          - input multiple notes

          triple, leading to an error "no multi selections in single mode"
